I'm just getting started with ES6 as I set up a universal JavaScript prototype. So far ES6 feels like a bunch of sugar with exception for the generator functions -- those feel new and shiny. But we should check out emotional response with some data. Which brings me to ask: How do we decide which language features to use? How we quantify our decision? We should focus our questions by choosing the most important features of our software.

I choose to focus on maintainability and user experience. For me this is can come at the expense of development speed and developer ergonomics, but my employer may feel otherwise.

So is adding ES6 features helping to make the software more maintainable or provided a better user experience? With sugar you can get more clear intent so +1 for maintainability.

Alright, gotta get back to work.
